# Property Price Impact Quantification
## Overview


The **Property Price Impact Quantification** project analyzes the relationship between various property characteristics and their impact on pricing. By utilizing web scraping techniques via ScraperApi, the project collects data on the location of the listing, price, size and many more. This data is then analyzed to quantify how these characteristics collectively influence the overall price of properties. The insights gained from this analysis provide valuable information for potential buyers or sellers.

## Features
* **Data Collection**: Utilizes ScraperApi for efficient web scraping, allowing for the retrieval of property data from the Idealista website
* **Data Analysis**: Implements algorithms to analyze the relationship between property characteristics and their corresponding prices.
* **Visualization**: Generates visualizations to illustrate the impact of different features on pricing, making it easier to understand the data. As well as a map to see on what listings the model generates higher/lower estimates
* **Results**: Provides quantifiable results indicating the financial implications of each property characteristic.
